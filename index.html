					<p> Hi there. I'm Sarah. I like to think of myself as someone who was raised and bathed in sunlight. Hopefully I can bring a little light into your life. <br><br> Please take a look around, everything you see on this site was made from scratch. Contact me if you REALLY like what you see and wanna throw me some coin *cough cough* I need a postgrad job :). <br><br> <strong>hobbies include:</strong> googling pictures of Antoni from queer eye, hiking, eating new foods, and telling my friends that they can be whatever they want.</p>
